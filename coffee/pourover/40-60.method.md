# 40-60 Method
The 4-6 method begins by dividing the total water into 40% and 60%.Â 

You pour the first 40% in two pours, and then decide how many pours you want to make for the last 60%. The first 2 pours decide the balance of the acidity and sweetness. The remaining number of pours will decide the strength of the coffee.

The amount of the water in the first and second pour decides the acidity and sweetness of the final cup. If you use more water in the first pour, the acidity will be stronger. But, if you use less water in the first pour, the overall sweetness will be stronger.
